    <td class="content_text">The Muslims of Vaniyambadi are known for their philanthropy and charity. They spend a major portion of their income for the development of Education both ecclesiastical and secular and also for social welfare. They have been ceaselessly and successfully working for the welfare of mankind, especially for the upliftment of the economically backward, socially oppressed, educationally backward and religiously ignorant people. Consistent to the Islamic tradition and Quranic injunctions, they had come forward to establish orphanages to translate the Islamic ideals into practice by transforming the destinies into fully developed, civilized, educated, socially committed and economically self-reliant citizens.<br /><br />
      The main objective of this institution right from the beginning of its inception is to provide basic amenities to the inmates so as to help them to achieve all round development of their personalities and to cater to their educational needs. Despite many ups and downs and trials and Tribulations in its chequered history, Yatheem Khana Ahl-e-Islam has been developing remarkably and today the strength of the inmates is about hundred.

<td class="content_text">This institution witnessed phenomenal growth under the guidance of eminent stalwarts such as Janab TM. Abdul Hameed Sahib, Janab Asangani Hajee Md. Ibrahim Sahib, Janab Mandi Abdul Jabbar Sahib, Janab P. Khaleelur Rahman Sahib and Janab T.M. Abdul Rahim Sahib. Without much publicity, this orphanage has been rendering remarkable service for the past 95 years. Rehabilitation of the destitute, backward and orphan children and moulding their personalities by this Yatheem Khana is a laudable and praiseworthy service to humanity which is in fact, in consonance with the guidance of Allah and the traditions of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). May the Almighty shower His choicest blessings on all those who are involved in this noble endeavor directly or indirectly.<br /><br />

  The need for a separate building was felt immediately after the establishment of the orphanage. Janab Asangani Hajee Abdul Khuddoos Sahib, the Secretary of the orphanage and Janab Chailappai Md. Ibrahim Sahib donated their land for the construction of the present building situated at 173, Md. Ali Bazaar, Vaniyambadi. It is reported in Nazeer, an Urdu weekly that the construction of the building was not completed during the lifetime of Ibrahim Sahib. However after his demise, his wife Janaba Khawja Bi Saheba extended her whole-hearted support for the completion of the work.<br /><br />
  
  Consequent to the tireless and ceaseless efforts of the prominent philanthropists of the day - notable among them are Janab T. Ameenuddin Sahib, Janab Cholavaram Abdullah Sahib, Janab Haji Zainulabideen Sahib and Janab Chengam Chanda Miyan Sahib - an orphanage was established in the year 1907 with only four orphans. It is popularly known as Yatheem Khana-e-Ahle Islam. The commendable role played by Janab Asangani Haji Abdul Khuddoos Sahib, the Secretary of the institution and Janab Moulvi Abdul Majeed Khan Sahib, the Arabic teacher from Madrasa-e-Mufeed-e-Aam in founding and developing the orphanage was highlighted in Muhammadia Mitran, a local Tamil Newspaper in its.</td>
